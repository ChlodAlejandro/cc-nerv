# NERV

Web interface/API used to connect [CC: Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/) computers
to the internet. Very specifically designed for a very specific modded server.
Named after [NERV](https://wiki.evageeks.org/Nerv) from Neon Genesis Evangelion,
because I affectionately named our ME System "[Magi](https://wiki.evageeks.org/Magi)".

Ran from January to February 2024. Now <s>tanged</s> decommissioned.

## Setup

Two comma-separated environment variables: `NERV_IPS` for allowed IP addresses, and
